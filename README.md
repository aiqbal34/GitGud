# MileStone 2 Notes


## Third party libraries
We plan to use Apple CloudKit to stay native since it is pretty much integrated with Swiftui and takes a burden away from authentication.
We also plan to use a styling library if need be since styling/ animations are something that takes a lot of time, and it would be easy to outsource it.
We are going to use PhoneNumberKit too since we have an OTP

## Apis
Firebase authentication API, Firebase FireStore with SwiftUI 

## Testing

We will have our roommates test the app and tell us how easy it was to make an account, and how intuitive the UI is, and have them rate it from one to 10. We will also ask them if they have any specific aspects of the UI they would want to be changed to make it more intuitive.
