# MileStone 1 Notes

## Design
*insert design here

## Third party libraries
We plan to use apple CloudKit to stay native since it is pretty much integrated with swiftui and takes a burden away from authentication.
We also plan to use a styling libaray if need be since styling/ animations is something that takes a lot of time, and it would be easy to out source it

## Apis
CloudKit is somewhat like an api, and we have some features we might integrate an api if we have time, with that we may have to migrate to a backend server, since right now we don't really need one since we are just doing get requests and post requests and there is no need for transforming the data that is coming in

## Testing

We will have our roomates test the app and tell us how easy it was to make an account, how intuitive is the UI, and have them rate it from one to 10.
